Trying something new
--------------------
If you have never used a service before, 
your first attempt to do so in the Cloud Control Panel 
will remind you that you are beginning something new 
and point out the first step you should take.

   *The Cloud Control Panel points out how to begin
   using a new service.*

When Rackspace makes a new service generally available, 
all customers are given access to that service. 
When a new service is made available to you, 
its endpoint is added to the 
`service catalog <http://docs.rackspace.com/auth/api/v2.0/auth-client-devguide/content/Sample_Request_Response-d1e64.html>`__ 
that is returned when you authenticate before using an API or CLI.

If you meet eligibility criteria, 
it may be possible for you to experiment with a new service 
before it is made available to all customers. 
The 
`Rackspace blog <http://www.rackspace.com/blog/?s=early+access>`__ 
is a good place to learn about 
limited-access and early-availability releases; 
signup procedures and contact information are included in 
each announcement.
