replaces and obsoletes 
all previous versions.

The guide is continuously improved. 
Our documentation source repository is open for review; 
to learn about everything that has changed recently, begin 
by 
`taking the repository's pulse <https://github.com/rackerlabs/docs-core-infra-user-guide/pulse>`__.
